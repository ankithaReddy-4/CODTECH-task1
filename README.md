Name: YENKAMOLLA ANKITHA Company: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS ID:CT08DS3647 Domain:Artificial Intelligence Duration:July-Aug 2024 Mentor: Overview: Data Preprocessing Objective: The objective of Task 1 is to preprocess raw data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis before applying AI algorithms. This involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data to improve the performance and reliability of AI models.

Key Activities: Data Generation:

Objective: Create a synthetic dataset for demonstration purposes. Key Activities: Use the make_classification function from sklearn.datasets to generate a dataset with 1000 samples and 20 features. Introduce some missing values and add a categorical column to simulate real-world data issues. Data Cleaning:

Objective: Handle errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in the dataset. Key Activities: Remove duplicates. Handle missing values by filling them with the mean. Correct data entry errors and inconsistencies. Detect and handle outliers. Data Transformation:

Objective: Convert data into a suitable format for analysis. Key Activities: Separate numerical and categorical features. Scale numerical data using StandardScaler. Encode categorical data using OneHotEncoder. Data Integration:

Objective: Combine different data preprocessing steps into a single pipeline. Key Activities: Use ColumnTransformer to integrate the numerical and categorical transformations. Data Splitting:

Objective: Divide the data into training and test sets to evaluate model performance. Key Activities: Use train_test_split to create training and test sets with an 80-20 split. Model Training:

Objective: Train a simple AI model to demonstrate the use of preprocessed data. Key Activities: Train a logistic regression model on the training data. Make predictions on the test data. Displaying the Output:

Objective: Show the results of the data preprocessing and model training steps. Key Activities: Print the shape of the processed data. Display the test accuracy of the model. Show a sample of the processed data. image
